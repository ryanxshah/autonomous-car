# Autonomous Car Computer Vision/Deep Learning Project

In this project, I trained a virtual car to drive around various tracks. I created three different models: A transformer planner, based on the Perceiver architecture, a convolutional neural network planner, and a multilayer perceptron planner.

* Designed a transformer planner based on the Perceiver architecture to train a virtual car to drive around various tracks by predicting waypoints based on lane boundaries. Also designed a convolutional neural network planner and a multilayer perceptron planner to compare performance.
* Implemented a custom training pipeline using PyTorch and fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve model accuracy and training eﬃciency.
* Achieved 90% track coverage and 100% track completion rate with the most optimal model.



## Watch the car drive! 🏎️

You can see how the car drives by navigating to the [videos](https://github.com/ryanxshah/autonomous-car/tree/main/videos) folder and downloading the videos of interest.

There are 2 videos for each model, the transformer planner and the multilayer perceptron planner. Each video corresponds to a different track.
